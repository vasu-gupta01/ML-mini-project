# Background

We will be using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) to compare three different Machine Learning models: Linear Regression, Softmax/Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.

There are 29 features, which includes 28 features named from V1 to V28 that are results from a PCA transformation to keep the original features confidential. The 29th feature is the transaction amount. The transactions are classified as either fraudulent (1) or not (0). The dataset contains 284,807 transactions out of which 492 are frauds (i.e. there is a huge imbalance).
